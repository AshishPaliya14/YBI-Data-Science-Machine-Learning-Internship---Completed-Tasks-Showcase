Task: Movie Recommendation System

For this task, I developed a basic recommendation system using Python and Pandas. I explored two popular approaches: Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering. Collaborative Filtering leverages user behavior to predict preferences and recommend items, while Content-based Filtering relies on item characteristics and user preferences. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing recommendation algorithms and analyzing movie datasets.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios and my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field of data science.
